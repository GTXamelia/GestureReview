@article{dos,
    Abstract = {The Learning Activity Packets (LAPs) contained in this manual are designed to assist the beginning user in understanding DOS (Disk Operating System). LAPs will not work with any version below DOS Version 3.0 and do not address the enhanced features of versions 4.0 or higher. These elementary activities cover only the DOS commands necessary to enable the first time user to become comfortable and knowledgeable with the utility system software and the operational command manuals. LAPs are individual packets of instruction which allow a student to learn at his/her own pace. Each LAP outlines objectives and required materials, and provides numerous figures for illustration, test questions, and answers. Activities include: (1) "System Components/Disk Operating System"; (2)"Keyboard/System Boot/Default Drive"; (3) "File Names/Directory Command/Internal and External Files"; (4) "Format Diskette"; (5) "Copy/Compare/Erase Files"; (6) "Disk Organization/Set Up"; (7) "Remove Subdirectories"; (8) },

@article{nonverbalgesture,
    Abstract = {Nonverbal communication is formed from a number of separate codes; this being universal is understood as well in all cultures. Also, along with the experience and age, grows our ability to communicate and messages sent indicate information about our problems or relationships with others. Nonverbal messages can sometimes contradict what we say, so nonverbal communication is unintentional. From the oldest classification, nonverbal communication is grouped into three big categories namely: signs language including gestures, actions language including body movements involved in different activities and objects language.
