@article{dos,
    Abstract = {The Learning Activity Packets (LAPs) contained in this manual are designed to assist the beginning user in understanding DOS (Disk Operating System). LAPs will not work with any version below DOS Version 3.0 and do not address the enhanced features of versions 4.0 or higher. These elementary activities cover only the DOS commands necessary to enable the first time user to become comfortable and knowledgeable with the utility system software and the operational command manuals. LAPs are individual packets of instruction which allow a student to learn at his/her own pace. Each LAP outlines objectives and required materials, and provides numerous figures for illustration, test questions, and answers. Activities include: (1) "System Components/Disk Operating System"; (2)"Keyboard/System Boot/Default Drive"; (3) "File Names/Directory Command/Internal and External Files"; (4) "Format Diskette"; (5) "Copy/Compare/Erase Files"; (6) "Disk Organization/Set Up"; (7) "Remove Subdirectories"; (8) },
